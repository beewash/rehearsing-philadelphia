      "description": "Cherry Street Pier is a 65,000 square foot warehouse and former shipping pier which was a vibrant part of Philadelphia’s shipping industry. Originally built in 1919 as Shipping Pier 9, it has been carefully repurposed to preserve and celebrate its historic value. Now open year-round, Cherry Street Pier operates as a mixed-use public space hosting artist studios, a public market, an open-air garden, multidisciplinary performances and art displays, and food and drink. The site is a reflection of Philadelphia today—creative, diverse, historic, adaptable, and inspired."
