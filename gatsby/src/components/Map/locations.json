From the outset, this extravagant monument was controversial for its location and its architecture, but has since been embraced as a distinctive emblem at the heart of the historic city. Topped by an iconic Philadelphia landmark, the statue of William Penn, the City Hall building is the largest municipal building in the United States and was the tallest building in the city of Philadelphia until 1987."

Now open year-round, Cherry Street Pier operates as a mixed-use public space hosting artist studios, a public market, an open-air garden, multidisciplinary performances and art displays, and food and drink. The site is a reflection of Philadelphia today—creative, diverse, historic, adaptable, and inspired."
